* Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Weighted
Ensemble (WE) method for sampling rare events from probability
distributions generated by arbitrary Markov processes.

* Installation

To put the =we= library where Python can find it, clone the repository
and execute the following from the top-level directory:

: sudo python setup.py install

* Acknowledgements

  Thanks to Rory Donovan for introducing me to the algorithm and for
  helpful comments on implementation.

** A note on the preferred nomenclature

   WE is a powerful yet very general sampling method, hence "the royal
   WE".  You know, the editorial...
